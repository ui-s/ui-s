<b>Hello</b>, this is my first time here. I don't have any knowledge on what Github or Git is -- I heard that it is important for programmers. And that's why I am here.
I want to become a software engineer or a data enginner and procure more knowledge on programming. I am on my first month of coding, I have learned the fundamentals on python,
html and learning CSS and javascript next. As my coding journey progresses, I hope to discover new things to let my aspirations come true. - <b>Ui-S</b>, 31/1/22 3:32am, inside my room.
